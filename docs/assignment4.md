** LABORATORY CLASS 4: TEXTURES IN PYTORCH3D **

In this class, we will learn how to work with textures in PyTorch3D. We'll explore the texture representations implemented in the library and relate it to our studies about images and  graphical objects in general.

**The goals of this practice are the following:**

-   Understand *texture* as an attribute of a graphical object
-   Load textured meshes in PyTorch3D
-   Get familirization with texture representations implemented in PyTorch3D
-   Visualize textured pointclouds

## Instructions and submission:

You are not required to deliver anything as assignment this time. We recommend you study the references below and ask us any questions if you have doubts. We provide you a demo in Google Colab for you to experiment and test some of the possibilities with PyTorch3D. To use Google Colab, you just need to have a google account and an associated Google Drive. You can make a copy of the notebook located below and modify it if you wish.
